`Final Project Code.ipynb`
Includes code to model BPM using various box score statistics. Also includes code to visualize the model and variables used in the model.

All data was found on basketballreference.com. Includes total stats for each NBA player from 2016-2020 who played enough games to qualify for the BPM stat. To get the data used, go to 
https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_totals.html and collect the total stats for each player and write it to a csv. Do this for the 2016-2020 seasons.

Also includes advanced stats for each NBA player from 2016-2020. To get the data used, go to https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_advanced.html and sort the column "BPM" to get rid of players that did not qualify for this category. Then get all the advanced stats for each player who qualified and write it to a csv. Do this for the 2016-2020 seasons.
